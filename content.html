    <h1>I'm Ian,</h1>
    <h2>a software developer</h2>

    <h2>and:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>a creative problem solver with passion for technology and innovations that improve, in the broadest sense, the way things are done</li>
      <li>an ambitious, reliable professional, driven to understand more about how technologies work from higher to lower levels</li>
      <li>an analytical thinker, determined to provide an ever better toolbox for inventive thought and solving increasingly difficult problems</li>
      <li>a caring Dad to three littles leading by example, and teaching honesty, patients, respect, curiosity, exploration,
        life-long learning, and having fun solving tricky puzzles.</li>
      <li>an optimist who, when the day is done, is already looking forward to waking up and doing better tomorrow.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>I first played with code when I was 7 years old after dear old Dad
      bought me a Commodore64 from an old man down the street. A box with
      hundreds of games on flimsy black floppy disks came with it so, needless to say, I spent more hours with it than anything else.</p>
    <p>I thoroughly enjoyed coding as a boy, teen and adult, returning to it more frequently than anything else throughout my life but
      (frustratingly) didn't pursue it as a profession.</p>
    <p>While spending most of last year inside, I realized a possible opportunity to shift my career away from IT and into the world of software
      development.</p>
    <p>I spent thousands of hours researching common software development technologies and the
      profession itself. I studied from books, articles, and online communities, completing many
      instructor-led courses offered online. I explored anything interesting, completing dozens of
      course projects and some of my own for multiple platforms including embedded, desktop, mobile,
      games, and web development. I also studied clean code, problem solving techniques, test driven
      development, design patterns, refactoring, and software construction.</p>
